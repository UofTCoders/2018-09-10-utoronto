    "To access additional functionality in a spreadsheet program, you need to click the menu and select the tool you want to use. All charts are in one menu, text layout tools in another, data analyses tools in a third, and so on. Programming languages such as Python have so many tools and functions so that they would not fit in a menu. Instead of clicking File -> Open and chose the file, you would type something similar to file.open('<filename>') in a programming language. Don't worry if you forget the exact expression, it is often enough to just type the few first letters and then hit Tab, to show the available options, more on that later.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since there are so many esoteric tools and functions available in Python, it is unnecessary to include all of them with the basics that are loaded by default when you start the programming language (it would be as if your new phone came with every single app preinstalled). Instead, more advanced functionality is grouped into separate packages, which can be accessed by typing `import <package_name>` in Python. You can think of this as that you are telling the program which menu items you want to use (similar to how Excel hides the Developer menu by default since most people rarely use it and you need activate it in the settings if you want to access its functionality). Some packages needs to be downloaded before they can be used, just like downloading an addon to a browser or mobile phone. The Anaconda distribution of Python essentially bundles the core Python language with many of the most effective Python packages for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in spreadsheet software menus, there are lots of different tools within each Python package. For example, if I want to use numerical Python functions, I can import the **num**erical **py**thon module, [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/). I can then access any function by writing `numpy.<function_name>`."

We can see that to use this function, we need to supply it with the argument a, which should be 'array-like'. An array is essentially just a sequence of numbers. We just saw that one way of doing this was to enclose numbers in brackets [], which in Python means that these numbers are in a list, something you will hear more about later. Instead of manually activating the menu every time, the JupyterLab offers a tool called the \"Inspector\" which displays help information automatically. I find this very useful and always have it open next to my Notebook. More help is available via the \"Help\" menu, which links to useful online resources (for example Help --> Numpy Reference).\n",

    "This is how a data frame is displayed in the JupyterLab Notebook. Although the data frame itself just consists of the values, the Notebook knows that this is a data frame and displays it in a nice tabular format (by adding HTML decorators), and adds some cosmetic conveniences such as the bold font type for the column and row names, the alternating grey and white zebra stripes for the rows and highlights the row the mouse pointer moves over. The increasing numbers on the far left is the data frame's index, which was added by `pandas` to easily distinguish between the rows.\n",

    "## What are data frames?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame is the representation of data in a tabular format, similar to how data is often arranged in spreadsheets. The data is rectangular, meaning that all rows have the same amount of columns and all columns have the same amount of rows. Data frames are the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and plotting. A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by an input function, such as `read_csv()`. In other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen above, the default is to display the first and last 30 rows and truncate everything in between, as indicated by the ellipsis (`...`). Although it is truncated, this output is still quite space consuming. To glance at how the data frame looks, it is sufficient to display only the top (the first 5 lines) using the `head()` method."
