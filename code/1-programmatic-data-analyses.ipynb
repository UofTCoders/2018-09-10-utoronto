    "## Working with computers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into more practical matters, I want to provide a brief background\n",
    "to the idea of working with computers. Essentially, computer work is about\n",
    "humans communicating with a computer by modulating flows of current in the\n",
    "hardware in order to get the computer to carry out advanced calculations that we are\n",
    "unable to efficiently compute ourselves. Early examples of human computer\n",
    "communication were quite primitive and included physically disconnecting a wire\n",
    "and connecting it again in a different spot. Luckily, we are not doing this\n",
    "anymore; instead we have programs with graphical user interfaces with menus and\n",
    "buttons that enable more efficient human to computer communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical user interfaces vs text based user interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of such a program that I think many of you are familiar with is\n",
    "spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc. Here, all\n",
    "the functionality of the program is accessible via hierarchical menus, and\n",
    "clicking buttons sends instructions to the computer, which then responds and sends\n",
    "the results back to your screen. For instance, I can click a button to send the\n",
    "instruction of coloring this cell yellow, and the computer interprets my\n",
    "instructions and then displays the results on the screen; in this case, the\n",
    "cell is highlighted yellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheet software is great for viewing and entering small data sets and\n",
    "creating simple visualizations fast. However, it can be tricky to design\n",
    "publication-ready figures, create automatic reproducible analysis workflows,\n",
    "perform advanced calculations, and reliably clean data sets. Even when using\n",
    "a spreadsheet program to record data, it is often beneficial to have some some\n",
    "basic programming skills to facilitate the analyses of those data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing commands directly instead of searching for them in menus is a more\n",
    "efficient approach to communicate with the computer and a powerful way of doing\n",
    "data analysis. This is initially intimidating for almost all people, but if you\n",
    "compare it to learning a new language, the process becomes more intuitive: when\n",
    "learning a language, you would initially string together sentences by looking\n",
    "up individual words in the dictionary. As you improve, you will only reference\n",
    "the dictionary occasionally since you already know most of the words.\n",
    "Eventually, you will throw the dictionary out altogether because it is faster and more\n",
    "precise to speak directly. In contrast, graphical programs force you to look up\n",
    "every word in the dictionary every time, even if you already know what to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal and natural languages\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think it is quite tricky to learn computer languages, but it is\n",
    "actually not! You already know one: mathematics is often written the same way\n",
    "as you would write it by hand, both in Excel and R."

    "\n",
    "- The console is the same as what we have been using so far. The advantage with\n",
    "  using the console within RStudio is that it interacts with the other panels.\n",
    "- So, if I read in the iris data we were working with previously, we can view it\n",
    "  in the console by typing `iris`, just like before, or we can also view the\n",
    "  `iris` variable in our environment tab, which shows it to us in a spreadsheet\n",
    "  or table format.\n",
    "- This panel shows the files in the current directory, any plots we might make\n",
    "  later, and also the documentation, which we accessed earlier by typing `?` in\n",
    "  front of a function. Here, the documentation is formatted in a way that is\n",
    "  easier to read and also provides links to the related sections.\n",
    "- Finally we have the text editor panel. This is where we can write scripts,\n",
    "  i.e. putting several commands of code together and saving them as a text\n",
    "  document so that they are accessible for later and so that we can execute them\n",
    "  all at once by running the script instead of typing them in one by one.\n",
    "- Another very useful thing with RStudio is that you have access to some\n",
    "  excellent cheat sheets in PDF format straight from the menu: `Help -> Cheatsheets`!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RStudio interface, we will be writing code in a format called the\n",

    "of the `iris` data frame, and we want the aesthetics of this plot to be that\n",
    "`sepal_length` is on the x axis and `sepal_width` is on the y-axis. Finally, we\n",
    "specify that we want this to be a plot of points, i.e. a scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(iris, aes(x = sepal_length, y = sepal_width)) +\n",
    "    geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot shows up in the plot panel in RStudio, which is far more convenient than\n",
    "having it show up as a separate window. You can already see that there seems to\n",
    "be at least some structure to the data. There is one cluster of points up the\n",
    "left corner and at least one in the lower right corner. Hmmmm, I wonder if\n",
    "these correspond to the different species of flowers... Let's find out, by\n",
    "coloring the points according to which species they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(iris, aes(x = sepal_length, y = sepal_width, color = species)) +\n",
    "    geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, it would be similarly easy to make a histogram of the `petal_length` and\n",
    "color it according to the species.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(iris, aes(x = petal_length, fill = species)) +\n",
    "    geom_histogram()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we could get fancier by instructing R to split this plot in vertically\n",
    "stacked facets, or subplots, with one species in each facet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(iris, aes(x = petal_length, fill = species)) +\n",
    "    geom_histogram() +\n",
    "    facet_wrap(~ species, dir = 'v')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you don't have a clear idea of what you are looking for in\n",
    "a data set -- such as if you are exploring publicly available data that you have not\n",
    "generated yourself -- then it can be useful to visualize the relationships\n",
    "between all the variables to get an overview of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggpairs(iris, aes(color = species))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot is a bit overwhelming, and the purpose here is not to produce\n",
    "a publication ready figure. You can see that many of the labels are overlapping\n",
    "and not everything fits in the plotting window. We can tweak these properties,\n",
    "which we will get into later in the course. But even in its slightly rough\n",
    "form, this is a powerful data set overview for your own analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, these examples have giving you an idea of how simple and powerful it\n",
    "is to use R for your exploratory data analyses. In a few lines of code, we have\n",
    "made some really nice plots, some of which are not even imaginable to create in\n",
    "Excel.\n",

    "### Saving data and generating reports\n",
    "\n",
    "To save our code and graphs, all we have to do is to save the R Notebook file,\n",
    "and the we can open it in RStudio next time again. However, if we want someone\n",
    "else to look at this, we can't just send them the R Notebook file, because they might\n",
    "not have RStudio installed. Another great feature of R Notebooks is that it is\n",
    "really easy to export them to HTML or PDF documents with figures and\n",
    "professional typesetting. There are actually many academic papers that are\n",
    "written entirely in this format and it is great for assignments and reports:\n",
    "I have used this myself for some of my progress updates to my supervisor. Since\n",
    "R Notebook files convert to HTML, it is also easy to publish simple good-looking\n",
    "websites in it -- for example, the syllabus website for this course is made this\n",
    "way via a template that Luke set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to convert this new document. First, let's go through it and see what\n",
    "we expect the output to include. First we see this intro section here -- this is called\n",
    "the yaml-block, and it's where you specify the title of your document, what kind of output you want,\n",
    "and a few other things that we will try later. Then we have a heading, a link, some bold text,\n",
    "and a few code blocks. OK, let's see what this looks like. To create the output\n",
    "document, we poetically say that we will knit our R Markdown into the HTML\n",
    "document. Luckily, it is much simpler than actually knitting something. Simply\n",
    "press the `Knit` button here and the new document will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the knitted document, the title showed up as we would expect,\n",
    "the lines with pound sign(s) in front of them were converted into headers and\n",
    "we can see both the code and its output! So the plots are generated directly in\n",
    "the report without us having to cut and paste images! If we change something in\n",
    "the code, we don't have to find the new images and paste it in again, the\n",
    "correct one will appear right in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The text format we are using in the R Notebook is called R Markdown. This format allows us to combine R code with the Markdown text format, which enables the use of certain\n",
    "characters to specify headings, bullet points, quotations and even \n",
    "citations. A simple example of how to write in Markdown is to use a single\n",
    "asterisk or underscore to *emphasize* text (`*emphasis*`) and two asterisks or\n",
    "underscores to **strongly emphasize** text (`**strong emphasis**`). When we\n",
    "convert our R Markdown text to HTML or PDF, these will show up as italics and\n",
    "bold typeface, respectively. If you have been writing on online forums, or\n",
    "popular chat services, such as whatsapp, you might already be familiar with\n",
    "this style of writing. In case you haven't seen it before, you have just learnt\n",
    "something about whatsapp in your theoretical ecology class...\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more familiar with the Markdown syntax, let's open a new R Notebook.\n",
    "RStudio already includes a template when you create new documents that gives\n",
    "you some instructions on how to use the syntax. We can see some of the\n",
    "formatting rules that we just mentioned. Let's add some emphasized text and see\n",
    "how it renders. Using the Markdown syntax we can organize our document with\n",
    "headings and subheadings, each indicated by a variable number of hash symbols."
